This algorithm is a part of this project, https://github.com/LeeDaeil/CNS_Autonomous.git

In case of novelty detection function in accident diagnosis algorithm, I am trying to develop it based on https://github.com/chen0040/keras-anomaly-detection

The accident diagnosis algorithm will be developed based on LSTM and Auto Encoders.

  1) To deal with time-series data, we decide to apply LSTM in overall project for development
  2) To sovle novelty detection problem, I have tried to apply Auto Encoder.
  3) To denosie fake data, I will try to apply Denoising Auto Encoder.
  
Based on development of accident diangosis algorithms, following journal articles are published.
